    "Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are both mathematical functions used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Probability Mass Function (PMF):*** The PMF is applicable to discrete random variables. It gives the probability of each possible outcome occurring. The PMF assigns a probability value to each specific value of the random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF for this scenario would assign a probability value of 1/6 to each outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) because each face of the die has an equal chance of occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Probability Density Function (PDF):*** The PDF is used for continuous random variables. It represents the likelihood of a random variable falling within a specific range of values. Unlike the PMF, the PDF does not give the probability of individual values; instead, it provides the relative likelihood of values within a range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Suppose we have a continuous random variable that represents the height of individuals in a population. The PDF for this variable would describe the likelihood of finding individuals within a specific height range. For instance, it might indicate that the probability density is higher for heights between 160 cm and 170 cm, suggesting that individuals within that range are more likely to be found in the population.\n",

    "***The Cumulative Density Function (CDF)*** is a mathematical function that gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value. It provides cumulative information about the probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Let's consider a continuous random variable representing the time it takes for a customer to complete a task at a service center. The CDF for this variable would give the probability that a customer's task time is less than or equal to a specific value.\n",

    "**Distribution comparison:** CDFs can be used to compare and analyze different probability distributions. By plotting multiple CDFs on the same graph, we can visually assess differences in their shapes, locations of percentiles, or probabilities at specific values.\n",
